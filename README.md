# PV Icarus: Solar Farm Inspection Tool

Welcome to the PV Icarus GitHub repository. This innovative tool revolutionizes the way solar farms are inspected and maintained, leveraging cutting-edge drone technology and artificial intelligence to detect and highlight defects in solar modules efficiently. Below, we outline the step-by-step process PV Icarus employs to ensure your solar farm operates at optimal efficiency.

## Overview
PV Icarus utilizes a combination of RGB (visible light) and IR (infrared) imagery captured by drones equipped with thermo cameras. These images are then processed through a sophisticated AI model to identify defects in individual solar modules within the farm. The process consists of several key steps, each designed to ensure the most accurate and comprehensive analysis of the solar farm's condition.

## Step 1: Image Acquisition
The first step involves flying a drone over the solar farm to capture high-resolution RGB and IR photographs. This dual capture mode allows us to analyze the solar farm from both a visual and thermal perspective, providing a comprehensive dataset for inspection.

## Step 2: Orthophoto Generation
From the captured photos, RGB and IR orthophotos are generated. An orthophoto is a geometrically corrected aerial image that represents the Earth's surface with uniform scale. It combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.

## Step 3: Segmentation of Solar Isles/Racks with AI
Utilizing artificial intelligence, the next step involves the segmentation of the entire solar farm into distinct solar isles or racks. This process is crucial for organizing the subsequent analysis and focusing on specific sections of the farm for detailed inspection.

## Step 4: Segmentation of Individual Solar Modules
After identifying the solar isles or racks, the AI model further segments the images into individual solar modules. This fine-grained segmentation is essential for pinpointing defects at the module level, ensuring that even minor issues are not overlooked.

## Step 5: Thermal Analysis of Each Solar Panel
With the individual solar modules identified, the system conducts a thermal analysis on each one. This step utilizes the IR imagery to detect anomalies that indicate defects or inefficiencies, such as overheating components or areas with poor conductivity.

## Step 6: Reconstruction of Entire Plant with Defective Solar Panels Highlighted
Finally, PV Icarus reconstructs a comprehensive view of the entire solar farm, integrating the analysis data to highlight defective solar panels clearly. This visualization makes it easy for maintenance teams to identify and prioritize repair work, ensuring the solar farm operates at maximum efficiency.
